# `chakracore-sys`

This is a library for the [JavaScript Runtime (JSRT)](https://goo.gl/1F6Gi1), an
API used for embedding Microsoft's ChakraCore into applications. This library
handles static and dynamic linking of the runtime, and generates rust
bindings (on the fly) for the interface. The entire API is generated and
accessable (though debugging functionality is only available if ChakraCore
was built with it).

A *Hello World* example can be found in
[src/lib.rs](https://github.com/darfink/chakracore-rs/blob/master/chakracore-sys/src/lib.rs).

An example of the generated bindings can be found
[here](https://gist.github.com/darfink/d519756ad88efcddfbfe895439cf9451).

## Requirements

Before being able to use this library, ChakraCore needs to be built. It is a
rather complex build process and the script is not stable, so this library does
not automate it (yet). Look
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Building-ChakraCore) for
build instructions. This library has been tested with the 1.3 release and
latest [master](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/commit/446b086d17).

The build script uses two environment variables to find the required files.

- `CHAKRA_SOURCE`: Should point to root of the ChakraCore checkout.
- `CHAKRA_BUILD`: Should point to the build directory of ChakraCore.  
By default it is `$CHAKRA_SOURCE/Build(Linux)/{BUILD_TYPE}`.

This script has not been tested with the `--embed-icu` option.

### Static/Shared

By default, this library links ChakraCore statically. There is a feature called
`shared` that builds it by linking to `(lib)ChakraCore.(so/dylib/dll)` instead.
On windows, only shared library builds are available as of this time. See
[#279](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/issues/279)

### Prerequisites

Besides ChakraCore and its dependencies, the library also uses Servo's
[rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen), which requires `clang-3.8`
or later. The build script utilizes, but does not require, `pkg-config`.

**NOTE:** The following instructions assume you already have ChakraCore's
 dependencies installed.

#### Windows

Ensure that you have `clang-3.8` or later installed. Downloads can be found
[here](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).  
Remember to add LLVM directories to `PATH` during installation.


ChakraCore is built using the MSVC ABI, therefore you must use the MSVC toolchain
when linking with this library (e.g `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)

#### macOS

```
# brew install llvm38 pkg-config
```

If you installed `icu4c` (required for ChakraCore) using Brew, and wish to link
statically, you need make `pkg-config` aware of the library. This is because Brew
does not link this library with the system, it may conflict with other builds.
There are two possible solutions to this.

- Forcefully link the library with the system:

  ```
  # brew link icu4c --force
  ```

- Or, before you build the library, export `icu4c`'s package configuration:

  ```
  # export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig
  ```

#### On Debian-based linuxes

```
# apt-get install llvm-3.8-dev libclang-3.8-dev pkg-config liblzma-dev
```

### Building

After building ChakraCore and installing all dependencies, prepare the build by
telling the script where the ChakraCore files can be found.

- ##### Windows

  Ensure that you are running in a Visual Studio command line environment,
  either by sourcing `vcvarsall.bat`, or by building from the Visual
  Studio Command Prompt.

  ```
  # SET CHAKRA_SOURCE=C:\path\to\chakracore\checkout
  # SET CHAKRA_BUILD=C:\path\to\chakracore\build\directory
  # cargo test -vv --features shared
  ```

- ##### Unix

  ```
  # export CHAKRA_SOURCE=/path/to/chakracore/checkout
  # export CHAKRA_BUILD=/path/to/chakracore/build/directory
  # cargo test -vv
  ```

When you run the build, there should be no *missing variable* warnings.

Remember that if you change the environment variables *after* running the build
script, you need to recompile it.

```
# cargo clean -p chakracore-sys && cargo build [--features shared]
```

In case you find yourself stuck in the build process, open an
[issue](https://github.com/darfink/chakracore-rs/issues/new).

### Status

This library has been built on `macOS 10.12 x86_64`, `Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64` and
`Windows 10 x86_x64`.
